# SoundFixerEXTRA

## [Click here to install latest version](https://github.com/mitchharvey/soundfixerextra/releases/latest)

an extension that lets you fix annoying sound problems on the web (e.g. in YouTube videos): sound in one channel only, too quiet even at maximum volume, too loud even at minimum volume.

*originally from https://github.com/valpackett/soundfixer*

all my modifications here: https://github.com/mitchharvey/soundfixerextra/compare/567ed56..master

### summary of changes:
- some vibe coded garbage, some human coded garbage, but works well enough for my purposes.
- save preferences for each site you visit, and persist those settings between sessions.
- extended the limit you can modify the volume (much louder/quieter limits than the original).
- It cannot change settings for cross-origin frames, same limitation as the original extension, but it will prevent you from doing so.
- added a badge to indicate the settings applied to the current page.
